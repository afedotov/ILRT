<h4>ILRT - What Is It?</h4>

<p>ILRT (Instrumentation Log Report Tool) is a utility I created to help detect and diagnose performance bottlenecks of <strong>IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition</strong> / <strong>IBM BPM</strong>, primarily in the Lombardi (BPMN processes) runtime. Lombardi process runtime has embedded instrumentation capabilities, and can record detailed system profile of every process or service activity. It is somehow described <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21613989">here</a>. Оutput of NonXMLDump utility provided by IBM is a human-readable but in fact is a big and raw instrumentation log which is very difficult to read and analyze by hand. ILRT parse such raw text instrumentation log and then produce report with statistical information and detailed aggregate profile of top expensive activities in a much more readable form.</p>

<p>Example of such report output can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/afedotov/ILRT/raw/master/example-reports/inst001.report.txt">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="small">
<p>It is very first version created to address some common problems, so it was written quick using <strong>Ruby</strong> language. It is very helpful, works well, but not as fast as we would like. Maybe someday I'll rewrite it on something more performant, Scala for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<br>
<h4>Download</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/afedotov/ILRT/raw/master/ilrt.rb" download>ilrt.rb</a> - If you on the Mac OS X, or your system has Ruby interpreter installed.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/afedotov/ILRT/raw/master/ilrt.jar" download>ilrt.jar</a> - It is binary compiled version based on JRuby, and is only required to have Java JRE to run.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Windows systems you can download and install Ruby interpreter from here - <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">http://rubyinstaller.org/</a></p>
<br>
<h4>How to Run</h4>

<p>First you should create plain text instrumentation log from binary log with <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21613989">IBM provided utility</a>. Note that default values for <code>dumpIfOver</code> and <code>truncateIfOver</code> are 10000 and 20000, so if your activities has more than 10k periods, such activities will be splitted and truncated. For logs with big and expensive activities I use much more bigger values here, so nothing will be truncated.</p>

<pre>
  <code>$ NonXMLDump inst001.dat -dumpIfOver 10000000 -truncateIfOver 10000000 &gt; inst001.txt</code>
</pre>

<p>Java version. You must set value for maximum heap with <strong>-Xmx</strong> option proportionally to instrumentation log size:</p>

<pre>
  <code>$ java -Xmx2048m -jar ilrt.jar -f inst001.txt -p</code>
</pre>

<p>Ruby version:</p>

<pre>
  <code>$ ./ilrt.rb -f inst001.txt -p</code>
</pre>

<p>After processing is completed report will be written to the <strong>{BASENAME}.report.txt</strong> file, in this case <strong>inst001.report.txt</strong>.</p>

<br>
<h4>Command-line options</h4>
<pre><code>Usage: ilrt [options]
    -f, --file PATH          IBM BPM Instrumentation Log File (txt format)
    -t, --top COUNT          Number of Expensive Activities to print, default = 10
    -p, --prof               Print Expensive Activities detailed profile
    -l, --level N            Expensive Activities detailed profile maximum depth level
    -s, --self               Print top self periods
    -d, --dump               Dump each Expensive Activity raw log to separate file
    -r, --rescan             Do not use cached index and forcibly rescan instrumentation log file
    -h, --help               Print help
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>
    Option <code>-l</code> is useful when you have very branchy profile tree and whant to limit depth to specific level, for example <code>-l 3</code> will produce such output:
    <pre class="small"><code class="small">9750 ms - Resume Workflow Engine [cnt=1,med=9750ms,max=9750ms]
|    5570 ms - Do Job, Worker=com.lombardisoftware.component.twscript.worker.ScriptWorker [cnt=15,med=213ms,max=1678ms]
|    |    2763 ms - Eval Script [cnt=15,med=1ms,max=1451ms]
|    |    2598 ms - EJB Calls, Method=PersistenceServicesCore.findByPrimaryKey [cnt=572,med=3ms,max=105ms]
|    |    209 ms - #self# [cnt=132,med=1ms,max=74ms]</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Option <code>-s</code> is useful to detect long <b>#self#</b> periods, that could potentially be due to GC pauses rather than valuable work.</li>
  <li>Option <code>-d</code> will extract portions of raw instrumentation log to separate files named <b>{FILENAME}.{THREAD}.{LINE}.thread.txt</b>, for each of top expensive activities. It is useful when you want manually review raw log of each expensive activity, and don't want to deal with large xGB instrumentation log.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h4>How to read report</h4>
<blockquote class="small">There is no guarantee that by looking at the ILRT report or raw instrumentation log you'll understand what's going on. This information is intended for professional consultants and performance engineers that deeply knows internal architecture of Lombardi process engine. It is not publicly documented by IBM. Here I will try to shed light on some traits of internal Lombardi architecture and how to read ILRT report.</blockquote>

<p>First report section displays overall aggregate statistics about key system transactions occured during instrumentation session. TPS stands for Transactions-Per-Second, it will help to measure workload degree.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Resume Workflow Engine</b>. This is main loop of <b>WorkflowManager</b> - stateful bean that perform human/system/etc services navigation. Navigation means executing single unit of work from current state to nearest checkpoint as defined by service steps flow, for example it could be full system service flow from Start to End, or from Coach to Coach for human service. Inside this loop WorkflowManager executes multiple service steps using specific Service Step Workers.</li>
  <li><b>Do Job (Service Step Workers)</b>. These are individual workers for each main service step types such as Server Script (ScriptWorker), Decision Gateway (SwitchWorker), Heritage Coach and Coach (CoachWorker, CoachNGWorker), Java Integration (JavaConnectorWorker), Web Service Integration (WSConnectorWorker), Advanced Integration Service (SCAConnectorWorker) and so on. Note that SubProcessWorker is invoked twice for each Nested Service call, in fact it performs execution context switching.</li>
  <li><b>PersistenceServices</b>. It is a common ORM API used by Lombardi process engine for storing different PO (Persistent Objects) in Relational Database. Each engine call to PersistenceServices results in a direct database access. For example, findByPrimaryKey loads single PO instance by its key from DB. Note that recorded period includes full time needed to query DB, construct PO instance, and perform all post-load operations, and strongly depends on PO type. For some PO types like BPDInstanceData it's only single DB query, for other like TWProcess post-load operation parses loaded XML definitions, and then queries several child PO's via corresponding DAO. So this report looks like average temperature of patients in hospital, but it helps to assess the overall performance.</li>
  <li><b>Task: Load/Save Execution Context</b>. This is time spent for load and save Execution Context of Task instance. Execution Context is the state of Task instance and its runtime variables, it is stored as serialized and compressed Java object in BLOB column. Time period is recorded inside of the specific helper, and includes every complex operations needed to load or save context: DB query, BLOB compression/decompression, serialization/deserialization, DB query to symbol table and shared object instances.</li>
  <li><b>BPD: Load/Save Execution Context</b>. This is time spent for load and save Execution Context of BPD instance. In fact this period includes only time needed to query BLOB from DB.</li>
</ul>


<br>
<p>Persistent Objects are divided into two different categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Versioned PO</b>. In case of runtime server it is 'immutable' objects associated with certain Versioning Context (i.e. Snapshot). Typically in this category are POs representing definitions of project artefacts like Processes (BPD), Services (TWProcess), Business Objects (TWClass).</li>
  <li><b>Unversioned PO</b>. In case of runtime server it is 'mutable' objects, usually some runtime data like Process instance and its context (BPDInstance, BPDInstanceData), Task instance (Task), Project, Branch, Snapshot and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>For improving performance, PersistenceServices usually not directly accessed from process engine. Instead for each PO type exists its own Factory, and within each PO Factory there are FIFO cache for POs. Size of this cache is set by config parameters <b>default-versioned-po-cache-size</b> and <b>default-unversioned-po-cache-size</b>.
Note that in cluster topologies for cached 'mutable' objects is reqiured to ensure cache coherence. Unfortunately its not so simple, and in IBM BPM this is not implemented. So for cluster topologies you need to disable Unversioned PO cache using config parameter <b>unversioned-po-caching-enable</b>.</p>

<p>Overall process engine performance strongly depends upon effective PO cache. To control cache efficiency ILRT report provides relevant section:</p>

<p>They divided on two groups for different thread pools:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>WebContainer</b>. This thread pool handles HTTP requests from client browsers. So it contain activities which perform service navigation (Human Services, AJAX/REST/Web Services) and Coach display. Also here will be Process Portal and administrative console activities.</li>
<li><b>ThreadPool worker</b>. This thread pool used by Lombardi engine's Event Manager to execute tasks from EM task queue. These tasks are intended for performing BPD instance navigation (DbNotificationBpdTask), executing UCA and BPD Timers (UcaExecutorTask, TimerNotificationBpdTask), executing automated System Tasks on BPD System Lane (ExecuteSystemLaneActivityTask).</li>
</ul>

<p>Time periods are recorded in in hierarchical way. Each period can have one or more child periods, as transaction can call multiple other triansactions within itself. So hereinafter <b>L1</b>, <b>L2</b> and so on stands for period depth level. <b>ActivityID</b> is simply a line number in source instrumentation log file, which is intended to identify and find specific activity.</p>


<p>Further in report are presented detailed profiles for each expensive activity. Profiles are presented in two forms.<br>
First is summary table with period breakdown separately for each depth level:

<p>Here we can see which periods took place on the root L1 level of activity, in this case they took 21636 ms in sum. These L1 transactoons calls other transactions inside, they are summarized in L2 periods breakdown and took 21611 ms in sum, and so on.
<br>
Looking at this profile what we can say?
<ul>
  <li>There was executed service navigation loop (Resume Workflow Engine) and it took 21627 ms.</li>
  <li>Seems like this service during execution calls multiple Nested Services, there are 70 SubProcessWorkers / 2 = 35 Nested Service calls. Only context switching has taken away a lot - 4433 ms.</li>
  <li>Most of time activity is spent in JavaScript evaluation and system DB access using PersistenceServices.findByPrimaryKey, the second looks quite strage and should be investigated in details.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Second is detailed activity profile formatted as hierarchical tree:</p>

<p>All periods in the tree are grouped and sorted by its summary time. In square brackets presented statistical info [<b>cnt</b> = number of recorded periods, <b>med</b> = median time, <b>max</b> = maximum time]. And <b>#self#</b> periods are used to show time spent in parent transactions itself.</p>

<p>Analyzing it, we can make the following conclusions:
